      "Michael WitmoreDirector, Folger Shakespeare LibraryIt is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since theircomposition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poemshave traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works tomake them their own.Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing processof “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings inlanguage that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a milea minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds. Theseexpertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource forstudy, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic textsof the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as FolgerDigital Texts, we place a trusted resource in the hands of anyone whowants them.The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basisfor the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of theirorigin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is thesingle greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. Anunparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, andartwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have beenconsulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editionsalso reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance ofShakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theater.I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and PaulWerstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’sworks, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with arichness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readerswho want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can followthe paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the Folgereither in-person or online, where a range of physical and digitalresources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I commendto you these words, and hope that they inspire.From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare Library\n",
      "Until now, with the release of the Folger Digital Texts, readers insearch of a free online text of Shakespeare’s plays had to be contentprimarily with using the Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of the plays. What is the difference? Manyordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: whatShakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare’s plays were not published theway modern novels or plays are published today: as a single,authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us inmultiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) andby the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, calledthe First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very differentversions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet,and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, andthen amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from theother versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or moreaccurate text.Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliarword could be understood in light of other writings of the period orwhether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it intoShakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred years ofprintings and misprinting; and even decisions based on culturalpreference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created, forexample, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda tochastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest,1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt nottake,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeareeditors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to herfather, Prospero.The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text longbefore scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to makethe thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The FolgerLibrary Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Digital Textsdepend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as ispossible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™, which hideeditorial interventions. The reader of the Folger Shakespeare knowswhere the text has been altered because editorial interventions aresignaled by square brackets (for example, from Othello: “If she inTextual IntroductionBy Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine\n",
      "\n",
      "chains of magic were not bound,”), half-square brackets (forexample, from Henry V: “With blood and sword and fire to win yourright,”), or angle brackets (for example, from Hamlet: “O farewell,honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?”). At any point in the text,you can hover your cursor over a bracket for more information.Because the Folger Digital Texts are edited in accord with twenty-firstcentury knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger hereprovides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, andstudents, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the playsand pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study andenjoyment of Shakespeare.\n",

      "Henry IV , Part 1, culminates in the battle of Shrewsbury between theking’s army and rebels seeking his crown. The dispute begins whenHotspur, the son of Northumberland, breaks with the king over thefate of his brother-in-law, Mortimer, a Welsh prisoner. Hotspur,Northumberland, and Hotspur’s uncle Worcester plan to take thethrone, later allying with Mortimer and a Welsh leader, Glendower.As that conflict develops, Prince Hal—Henry IV’s son and heir—carouses in a tavern and plots to trick the roguish Sir John Falstaff andhis henchmen, who are planning a highway robbery. Hal and acompanion will rob them of their loot—then wait for Falstaff’s lyingboasts. The trick succeeds, but Prince Hal is summoned to war.In the war, Hal saves his father’s life and then kills Hotspur, actionsthat help to redeem his bad reputation. Falstaff, meanwhile, cheats hissoldiers, whom he leads to slaughter, and takes credit for Hotspur’sdeath.Synopsis\n",

But soft, whom have we here? Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?  I did; I saw him dead, Breathless and bleeding on the ground.—Art thou alive? Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight? I prithee, speak. We will not trust our eyes Without our ears. Thou art not what thou seem’st.  No, that’s certain. I am not a double man. But if I be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a jack. There is Percy. If your father will do me any honor, so; if not, let him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either earl or duke, I can assure you.  Why, Percy I killed myself, and saw thee dead.  Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying.

For my part, if a lie may do thee grace, I’ll gild it with the happiest terms I have. The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours. Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field To see what friends are living, who are dead.  I’ll follow, as they say, for reward. He that rewards me, God reward him.

Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend, Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse, Stained with the variation of each soil Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours, And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news. The Earl of Douglas is discomfited; Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights, Balked in their own blood, did Sir Walter see On Holmedon’s plains. Of prisoners Hotspur took Mordake, Earl of Fife and eldest son To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Atholl, Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith. And is not this an honorable spoil? A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?  In faith, it is a conquest for a prince to boast of.  Yea, there thou mak’st me sad, and mak’st me sin In envy that my Lord Northumberland Should be the father to so blest a son, A son who is the theme of Honor’s tongue, Amongst a grove the very straightest plant, Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride; Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him, See riot and dishonor stain the brow Of my young Harry.
